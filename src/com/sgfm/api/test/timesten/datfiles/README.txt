This directory holds the data files read by 
the 'level#.java' JDBC sample programs that simulate the operation of a 
simple order-processing database.

The 'level#.java' JDBC sample programs can be found in the 
<timesten_install_dir>/quickstart/sample_code/jdbc/directory. 
They impact the following database tables, 
all of which are part of the sampledb_1122 schema:

appuser.product
appuser.inventory
appuser.customer
appuser.orders
appuser.order_item

The input1.dat, input2.dat, and input3.dat files 
are used to add, delete, and modify the data in the demo schema.

To compile and run the JDBC sample programs, follow the instructions listed
in the <timesten_install_dir>/quickstart/sample_code/jdbc/README_jdbc.txt 
file.
